# Developing a Handwritten Digits Classifier with PyTorch

This project demonstrates how to build and train a neural network for handwritten digit recognition using **PyTorch**, achieving **\~97% accuracy** on the **MNIST dataset**.

It was developed as part of my **AWS-sponsored machine learning journey**, giving me hands-on practice with deep learning concepts, model evaluation, and deployment workflows.

## üìñ Why this project?

Handwriting recognition is one of the earliest and most practical applications of deep learning in computer vision. By building this digit classifier, I:

* Gained practical experience with **PyTorch** for model building and training.
* Learned how **preprocessing and normalization** improve training stability.
* Practiced **hyperparameter tuning** to push accuracy above 97%.
* Built a **reusable pipeline** for future OCR projects.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Project Steps

1. **Data Loading**

   * Pulled the MNIST dataset using `torchvision.datasets`.
   * Split into training, validation, and test sets.

2. **Preprocessing**

   * Converted images to tensors.
   * Normalized pixel values to \[-1, 1] for stable learning.

3. **Model Architecture**

   * Implemented a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) with ReLU activations.
   * Used **CrossEntropyLoss** with the **Adam optimizer**.

4. **Training & Validation**

   * Ran for 20 epochs while tracking accuracy and loss.
   * Achieved **\~97% accuracy** on the test set.

5. **Model Export**

   * Saved trained weights with `torch.save()` for future inference.
